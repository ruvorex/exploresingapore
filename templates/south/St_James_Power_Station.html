                        St James Power Station was gazetted as a National Monument in 2009 and has been part of Mapletree’s portfolio in the HarbourFront Precinct since the establishment of Mapletree in 2000. As part of Mapletree’s
                        strategy for the HarbourFront Precinct which lies at the heart of the Greater Southern Waterfront, Mapletree embarked on the execution of the addition and alteration works for St James Power Station in 2018, with
                        the preservation of the historical architectural elements of the iconic monument integrated with modern building technologies.<br>
                        <br>
                        New floating floor slabs were sensitively inserted at selected locations within the power station to introduce additional space for modern office use while preserving the original spatial quality. Large atrium
                        spaces were also created at various locations to accentuate the large voluminous spaces. Key architectural elements including the fair-faced brick façade, two chimneys, mild steel windows and the steel frame
                        structures were painstakingly restored to showcase the charm of the architecture.<br>
                        <br>
                        The result is the creation of a one-of-a-kind experience and inspirational ambience suited for the best-in-class users. Mapletree has leased St James Power Station to Dyson, a leading global technology company,
                        as its global HQ and research centre.<br>
                        <br>
                        The newly refurbished St James Power Station will also house a heritage gallery in one of its distinctive chimneys and a heritage trail featuring maritime artefacts around the monument. The St James Power Station
                        Heritage Trail and Gallery reflects the nation’s history as a trading hub, its rich heritage and progressive transformation over the years into a world-class city centre.

                        <span id="smallheader">Harpoon</span><br>
                        Commercial whaling was common in the mid-19th century and was historically associated with Imperial Union and later Soviet Union. This harpoon gun was mounted on a ship named Voskhititely' meaning ‘Delightful'.
                        The ship was in commission from 1962, and would often dock in Singapore during its expeditions to the Indian Ocean. Whaling eventually declined in the 1970s due to its controversy. The harpoon gun was gifted in
                        1974 to the Maritime Museum before " Voskhititely' went out of commission in 1980.

                        <span id="smallheader">Mild Steel Windows</span><br>
                        The facades of St James Power Station feature tall mild steel windows with green glazing. The Lofty windows resemble the those of cathedral buildings, bathing the interiors with a soft, diffused light. The
                        signature green tint is characteristic of early glass windows, a popular material of the 1920s, which reduces glare from the harsh tropical sunlight. The window design can be traced to a 1925 catalogue of the
                        Crittall ‘Fenestra’ range. Founded during 1889 in Essex, England, Crittall Windows Ltd. pioneered the mass production of windows with minimum sightlines, strength, security, quality finishing and distinct
                        elegance. These qualities made Crittall Windows sought-after for Modernist landmarks.

                        <span id="smallheader">Habour</span><br>
                        The New Harbour, at the present area around Keppel Harbour and HarbourFront Precinct, had its early beginnings in the 14th century. The area was bustling with the movement of goods and people through new ports,
                        roads and railways. St James Power Station was set close to the New Harbour for its proximity to the sea and port infrastructure, crucial to its operations. Today, the harbour has transformed dramatically, with
                        its former industrial use replaced by leisure and lifestyle activities over the past two decades. The historic artefacts displayed in this heritage trail are rare vestiges of Singapore's first and oldest
                        deep-water harbour

                        <span id="smallheader">Tanjong Pajar Gatepost</span><br>
                        These two cast-iron gate posts possibly date back to 1864, when they marked the entrance to Victoria Dock, owned by the Tanjong Pagar Dock Company. By 1913, the colonial government had taken control of the
                        Tanjong Pagar Dock Company. They established the Singapore Harbour Board, which was eventually replaced by the Port of Singapore Authority [PSA]. The gateposts have remained in place, witnessing more than a
                        century of the transforming docklands.

                        <span id="smallheader">Anchor</span><br>
                        Standing nearly two metres high, this anchor was commonly used in vessels during the 20th century Patented by John Francis Hall at the beginning of the 1900s, its Lack of horizontal arms made it easier to stow in
                        the ship through a hole known as the hawsepipe. Its cylindrical shank (instead of the usual sharp-edged shanks) differentiates this model from other anchors. Refined from earlier anchor designs, Hall's stockless
                        anchor became the model for the modern anchors and continues to be used today.

                        <span id="smallheader">Steam Crane</span><br>
                        This 10-ton Steam Crane, named Works Number 683, was made by John H. Wilson & Company of Sandhills, Liverpool. It was installed beside Albert Dock and ran along the docks on a fixed set of railway tracks. The
                        steam crane is composed of parts made by different companies in the UK. The railway tracks for the steam crane were supplied by the British Steel Corporation's (BSC] rail making plant in Workington. They also
                        once provided the rails for Singapore's MRT systems for 30-40 years. These constant upgrades have allowed the steam crane to function for more than 100 years before its decommissioning in 1983.

                        <span id="smallheader">Stone Post</span><br>
                        These two stone posts have stood at the boundary of the P&0 wharf since the 1850s. The P&0 wharf was built at the New Harbour, where its deep-water conditions were ideal for the significantly larger steamships.
                        The wharf likely stood in place until the Singapore Harbour Board bought it in 1926. In 1977, the land was used to build the World Trade Centre, later renamed as HarbourFront Centre.
